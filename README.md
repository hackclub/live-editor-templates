# Microworlds are a place to discover powerful ideas!

This is Hack Club's code editor which integrates workshops, documentation, and sharing tools.

To load a Microworld into the environment use the url query `file` like so: `microworld.hackclub.dev?file=microworld-name`.

The Microworlds are available in this [repo](https://github.com/hackclub/micros).

## Running Locally

To run the Microworld editor locally just download the repo and run a server. I reccomend the npm package [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).
