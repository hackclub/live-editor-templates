# Microworlds are a place to discover powerful ideas!

This is Hack Club's code editor which integrates workshops, documentation, and sharing tools.

To load a Microworld into the environment use the url query `file` like so: 

```
microworld.hackclub.dev?file=microworld-name
```

The Microworlds are available in this [repo](https://github.com/hackclub/micros).

## What is a Microworld?

A Microworld is a single page code editor environment. Each Microworld loads in an interpreter which will receive your code, evaluate it, and render accordingly. Each Microworld also provides documentation which you can access by hitting `docs`. After creating something in your Microworld share it to Scrapbook by hitting `share`, pressing the link, and filling out the sharing form.

## Running Locally

To run the Microworld editor locally just download the repo and run a server. I reccomend the npm package [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).
