# Turtle Art in JavaScript

Let's make some art with the turtle.

We have only a few functions we need to learn.

```
const width = 300;
const height = 300;

setCanvasSize(width, height); // set the canvas size
fillScreen("white"); // set the background

const t = createTurtle(150, 150); // create a drawing turtle with starting x and y

t.forward(30) // go forward and leave a trail
t.setColor("blue") // change the color
t.right(45); // turn right 45 degrees
t.arc(32, 40); // make and arc with angle 32 and radius 40
t.left(30); // turn left 30 degrees
t.setSize(3); // set the pen size
t.goto(50, 200); // go to x 50 and y 200
t.setAngle(90); // set the angle to 90 degrees
t.up(); // pick up the pen so you don't draw
t.forward(40);
t.down(); // put down the pen so you do draw
t.forward(30);

```

That's every command you need to learn.

With just a few of them you can make amazing patterns like this:
